Thank you for using **Vidwall**! We highly value your privacy. This document explains how we handle your data when you use this app.

## Information Collection

**Vidwall** is a macOS local tool designed to help you set 4K videos as dynamic desktop wallpapers, supporting video formats such as MP4 and MOV. All operations are performed locally on your device.

**Important Note:** Vidwall operates completely offline. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app does not connect to remote servers or integrate any third-party services.

Vidwall does not generate or send any logs. All operations and configurations are performed locally, with no remote communication involved.

## Use of Data

Since Vidwall does not collect or store any user data, there is no use or sharing of data. All of your usage remains private and offline.

## Third-Party Services

Vidwall does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising platforms, or cloud services, nor does it share or sell user information to any third party.
